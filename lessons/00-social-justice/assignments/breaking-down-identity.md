# Assignment: Breaking Down Identity

Our identities are complicated. We carry with us many different affinities, including race, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and class, just to name a few. Some parts of ourselves may garner privilege, while others may be culturally marginalized.  We can use the term “intersectionality” to refer to this understanding of multiplicity.

Please answer the following reflection questions on a separate paper.

1. List as many of your own identity categories as you can: (e.g. race, class, gender, age, religion, education, family structure, etc)

 - Filipino, able-bodied, Asian, Democrat, low-income, immigrant, queer, trans, 23 years old, graduated university (B.A.), extended family, no children 


2. Which part of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?

 - Being queer because of how I dress, the small-talk I would have with people, and because I just like pointing out the fact that I am queer because it took me so long to accept myself to this point. 

3. Which part of your identity are you least aware of on a daily basis?
 
 - Being able-bodied since a lot of structures are built around people of the same ability (walking up stairs, being able to run when trying to catch the bus, having the motor skills to open doors). I have a brother who has autism and sometimes I also forget that he processes social cues differently from how I do, which can lead to arguments sometimes.
 
4. Which part of your identity was the most emphasized growing up?

 - Being Filipino since I grew up close to my family (including my extended family) and they are the people I interact with the most. And that, to this day, I have strict parents so a lot of the things I could and couldn't do were dictated by them. 

5. Which part of your identity do you feel is the most misunderstood?

 - My transness since I still get called a woman or a girl by people who see me as a cis-woman. My relationship with my gender is in a comfortable gray area where I know how I don't identify as a  cis-female but also how I'm comfortable with not adhering to labels. I feel like, even within the queer community, I have to identify with a label and not doing so means I must not be \*insert identity\* enough.

6. Which part of your identity do you feel is the most difficult to discuss with those who identify differently?

 - Being queer because depending on who I speak to, straight or queer, depending on their beliefs I could either get an accepting person or someone who condemns me to hell. I find the concept of just accepting people as they are and celebrating our diversity as people can be difficult to grasp for certain people.

7. Which part of your identity grants you the most privilege?

 - My able-bodiedness (see #3)

8. Which part of your identity feels the most marginalized?

 - It's inaccurate to say my Filipino and queer identity would tie but because my queer identity is what I feel to be the identity I'm most aware of, I would say my queer identity.
