#Assignment: Reflection One
*Brief responses are just fine.*

1. List at least 5 examples of institutional racism. Try to come up with these independently, but use google if needed.
  - There is a lack of Black students in higher institutions because they aren't encouraged by society to pursue these/lack of resources that cater specifically to them and their needs.
  
  - In the United States, requiring US Citizenship for certain jobs, eliminating non-citizens from these job pools who are often people of color.
  
  - Not recognizing the Native American land we stand on when these lands were stolen from them (#NoDAPL, no federal recognition for the Duwammish tribe in "Seattle").
  
  - People of Color compromising of majority of the encarcerated population because they are at higher risk of being targeted by police.

  - When people of color are put in leadership position, they are not celebrated on their merit but rather one of the first assumptions is that a company had to fill a "diversity quota"

2. What, if anything, was a new concept to you in this section? Does this raise any further questions for you?
